#### pH Sensor 
A glass electrode pH sensor functions based on the principle of ion-selective glass membrane potential. Comprising a specialized glass membrane and a reference electrode, the sensor operates by exploiting the selective permeability of the glass membrane to hydrogen ions (H⁺) present in the solution being measured. As hydrogen ions interact with the glass surface, an ion exchange occurs, leading to the generation of a potential difference across the membrane. This potential difference is proportional to the pH of the solution, with higher concentrations of hydrogen ions resulting in higher potentials, indicative of lower pH values (more acidic solutions), and vice versa. This electrical potential is measured by a sensitive electronic circuit in comparison to a stable reference voltage provided by the reference electrode. Calibration of the sensor is essential to relate the measured potential difference to the pH of the solution accurately. 
By using standard buffer solutions with known pH values, a calibration curve is established, facilitating the conversion of measured potential into pH units. In optimal conditions, a perfect neutral solution, such as pure water at 25°C (77°F), should yield a voltage of 0 when measured by the pH electrode, reflecting an equal concentration of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions. Despite theoretical ideals, practical considerations such as impurities and environmental factors may introduce slight deviations from ideal pH measurements, underscoring the importance of regular calibration to ensure accuracy in pH readings.
